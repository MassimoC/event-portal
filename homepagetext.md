# Join the  Global DevOps Experience om June 15 2024!
Welcome to the Global DevOps Experience, a unique, global event where the worlds of DevOps, Platform Engineering, and Developer Experience (DevEx) come together. 

This one-day event will be hosted by many venues all over the world and is more than an event. It is an experience. You will be part of a team in a fictious company, Globoticket, and help them to overcome some difficult and relevant challenges in the field of Platform Engineering, DevOps and Software Development. The event is centered around GitHub and Azure and AI and is the first global GitHub community event!

# What is the GDEX
In 2017 the makers of GDEX created the [Global DevOps Bootcamp](https://globaldevopsbootcamp.com) which was held in 2019 for the last time. In 2019 GDBC had 10000 people joining the event in 92 venues in 32 countries all over the world. A true global community event. The Global DevOps experience follows a similar concept. The Global DevOps Experience is an "Event out of the box" and follows the sun. We will start in New Zealand and will end the event 36 hours later in Seattle. This means you can join anywhere and get the same experience!
